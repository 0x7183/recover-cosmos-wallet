# Recover-Cosmos-Wallet

This tool can be used to recover your Cosmos wallet if you lost one word of your seed phrase.
This is possible using a simple brute forcing algorithm that tries all the possible combinations.

Thanks to [@demennu](https://github.com/Demennu) and [@jiooji](https://github.com/Jiooji) for the help!

All the computation is done locally so the process may take a while and we'll not be able to steal your seed phrase.

if you'd recover your crypto and you would like to thank us you can make a donation here:

* Terra: `terra123`
* Juno: `juno123`
* Cosmos: `cosmo123`

## Best practice

* Insert your seed without internet connection
* Double check each word while inserting the seed phrase.
* Get and use an hardware wallet (like Ledger)
* Once recovered your seed move all your funds to a new wallet

## When creating a new wallet:

* Write down your seed phrase double checking each word
* Copy your address
* Delete the new wallet
* Recover using the seed phrase and check the address generated
* If the new address matches the old one you can move your funds to the new wallet
* If not delete the wallet and restart from the first point
